1. Start by opening scene 'Base'.
2. Change the value of 'first scene' in the collision volume to desired scene to load.
3. Scenes should be 16 units by 9 units in size (screen marker object provided) and centered on (0,0).
4. Loaded scenes should not have their own camera or player, that is brought in from the base scene.
5. Scenes are connected via 'screen edge' objects that handle transitions (currently 50% working)
